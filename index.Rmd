## Pictures of kittens

One kitten:

<img src = "https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Cute-Cat.jpg" class = "displayleft" alt = "a cute kitten"/>


```{r graphics, fig.align = 'center', echo = F, out.width="75%"}
# This is much more flexible than the above. 
# The html above would need to pull a pre-size image or use a separate
# html style sheet. 
knitr::include_graphics("brain_art.jpg")
```

#Another kitten:
```{r graphics, fig.align = 'center', echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://sayingimages.com/wp-content/uploads/you-have-kitten-memes.jpg")
```
